Super-simple shortcodes to control what's in your RSS feed.

== Description ==
This plugin gives you two new shortcodes: [killinfeed] will prevent whatever it\'s wrapped around from being included in your site\'s RSS feed, and [addtofeed] will add exclusive feed-only content. It\'s especially useful for wrapping around multimedia shortcodes that are adding bits and pieces of the media player into your feed, or for making content exclusive to only one consuming audience. For example, you could use it to display an ad on your site but not in your RSS feed, or show an exclusive link or promotion to your podcast subscribers but not to your website visitors.

== Installation ==
1. Upload WP Kill In Feed to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the \\\'Plugins\\\' menu in WordPress.
3. Enjoy!
4. If you use PowerPress, turn off "Do not allow other plugins to modify podcast feeds" in PowerPress > Settings > Feeds.

== Changelog ==
v1.2: Improved content handling for better compatibility.
v1.1: removed smartquotes in shortcode addtofeed 
v1: initial upload
