Super-simple shortcodes to controll what's in your RSS feed.

== Description ==
This plugin gives you two new shortcodes, [killinfeed] and [addtofeed], that will prevent whatever it\'s wrapped around from being included in your site\'s RSS feed, or add exclusive feed-only content, in that order. It\'s especially useful for wrapping around multimedia shortcodes that are adding bits and pieces of the media player into your feed.

== Installation ==
1. Upload WP Kill In Feed to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the \\\'Plugins\\\' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate Settings ->WP_FOAAS Settings for hints on how to construct shortcodes.
4. Enjoy!
